## What is the Beacon Project doing to mitigate the possibility and likelihood of reidentification through Beacons?

Any publica data resource containing "human derived" data has a potential for re-identification attacks, that is the identification of individuals contributing data to the resource.

Since its inception, the Beacon Project has been actively working with experts in GA4GHâ€™s membership to address potential privacy concerns.

These efforts include:

* A data aggregation approach, in which several private Beacons are combined into a single public Beacon. The power to re-identify is a function of the number of data points served by a Beacon and the scope of the data it contains (i.e. whole genome versus exome). Aggregate Beacons contain more data points and do not obscure the origin of the data.
* An information budgeting approach to track the cumulative information revealed to any one user and restrict access if information disclosure exceeds a threshold. The power to re-identify an individual varies inversely with the frequency of the alleles being queried. That is, very rare alleles reveal more about a given individual than those that are common among the population. By metering the information disclosure, Beacons can restrict access before reidentification is possible.
* Secured access to some of the data. Before a user is approved to access data, s/he must provide credentials and/or research plans and agree not to re-identify individu
