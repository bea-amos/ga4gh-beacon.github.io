## {{ page.title }}

The Genomic Variants Team evaluates "structural" types of genomic variants
with respect to their representation & query through current & future versions
of the Beacon API. This scope intersects with work being pursued in the
[ELIXIR h-CNV community](https://hcnv.github.io) and considers standards under
development by the GA4GH GKS workstream.
