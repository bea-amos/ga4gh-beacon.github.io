Beacon is an ever changing product, and itâ€™s a good thing! 
Our partners in research and clinical settings are helping us improve version 2, who will soon be submitted for approval to GA4GH. 
In the meantime, we have not had a chance to finalize the documentation. Here is a list of resources, with their corresponding versions, to help you navigate our documentation while we prepare a beautiful repository just for you.

Version 2, draft 3:
* Specification
* Default schema

Version 2, draft 2:
* [Specification](https://github.com/ga4gh-beacon/specification-v2/releases/tag/draft.2)
* [Default schema (code)](https://github.com/ga4gh-beacon/specification-v2-default-schemas/releases/tag/draft.2)

The reference implementation is in progress: the version compliant with draft 1.5 is here [here](https://github.com/EGA-archive/beacon-2.x).
