## Beacon training course | How to make COVID-19 sensitive data discoverable using Beacons

The online workshop [**BEACON - How to make sensitive data discoverable**](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1SdWCPhmX4Pb_tF4Pw6AyrGADeWBaBMj6/edit#heading=h.gq5n092lscjf) will take place on November 2 and 3. The [European Genome-phenome Archive (EGA)](https://ega-archive.org/) Beacon Team will provide a special hands-on training session for the [BY-COVID](https://by-covid.org/) partners for "Beaconising" the datasets.

The training will be divided in two sessions:

- **Session I – Understanding Beacon and Mapping of BY-COVID human data onto Beacon model**. This part is oriented towards clinicians or researchers handling human data (mutations, variants, Covid-19 patients etc), genomics data (VCF files) and/or associated phenoclinic metadata and would like to understand the architecture of Beacon and map their data onto the Beacon model.
- **Session II – Implementation or deployment of Beacon on datasets**. This part is oriented towards programmers/bioinformaticians, and some command line knowledge is required. This will be a **hands-on session to deploy Beacon reference implementation (Beacon-RI) on a mock dataset or real dataset generated in session 1**.

Find out more information about the sessions and the full program [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1SdWCPhmX4Pb_tF4Pw6AyrGADeWBaBMj6/edit#heading=h.gq5n092lscjf).

The Beacon online workshop is free and open to anyone! [Registration](bit.ly/3D7kOOF) will be open until __October 31st__.
