## Beacon v2 will be at the International Congress of Human Genetics (ICHG) with a hands-on session on Discovery

The Hands-on workshop “How to make sensitive data discoverable” will take place on February the 26th, in the framework of the [International Congress of Human Genetics (ICHG)](https://www.ichg2023.com/), that is being held in Cape Town from February 22 – 26.

The hands-on training course aims to provide knowledge about what is Beacon, how was it developed and which are the three different scenarios that can be faced by an institution that wants to deploy a Beacon. The training course will take place within the framework of the ["Federated data analysis workshop"](https://www.cineca-project.eu/news-events-all/federated-data-analysis-workshop), organised by the CINECA project.
The workshop, provided in this occasion by Mamana Mbiyavanga (H3Africa, UCT, South Africa), Mauricio Moldes (Europen Genome-phenome Archive, CRG, Barcelona, Spain) and Coline Thomas (European Genome-phenome Archive, EMBL, Hixton, United Kingdom), will share with the participants three queries to try the Beacon potential. You can try one of them from your computer too: 
- ["Do we see the variant A > G in position 160500074?"](https://ega-archive.org/beacon-apis/cineca/g_variants/?start=16050074&end=16050075&alternateBases=G&referenceBases=A)

# The current Beacon V2 Reference Implementation (B2RI) 
The B2RI is a free opensource software package that includes tools for lighting up a Beacon out-of-the-box. You can read more about in the [Beacon V2 Reference Implementation (B2RI) paper](https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/38/19/4656/6671215?login=false), as it is now open access to know more about this set of tools that enables federated sharing of genomic and phenotypic data.

# About the International Congress of Human Genetics
Hosted by the [African Society of Human Genetics (AfSHG)](https://www.afshg.org/) and the [Southern African Society for Human Genetics (SASHG)](https://sashg.org/), the International Congress of Human Genetics reunite international experts to highlight how genomic technologies are being managed to address challenges generated by the current status of Human Health and Genomics.
