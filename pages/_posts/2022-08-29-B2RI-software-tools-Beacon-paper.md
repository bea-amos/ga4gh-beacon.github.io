#### Beacon V2 Reference Implementation: a Toolkit to enable federated sharing of genomic and phenotypic data
##### Manuel Rueda, Roberto Ariosa, Mauricio Moldes, Jordi Rambla

The Beacon team at the [European Genome-phenome Archive (EGA)](https://ega-archive.org/) presents the [**Beacon v2 Reference Implementation (B2RI)**](https://doi.org/10.1093/bioinformatics/btac568), a set of open-source software tools to enable federated sharing of genomic and phenotypic data.

B2RI follows the **Beacon v2 specification**, which since April 2022 defines an open [Global Alliance for Genomics and Health (GA4GH)](https://www.ga4gh.org/) standard for secure federated discovery of genomic and phenotypic data in biomedical esearch and clinical applications.

This toolkit will facilitate the "beaconization" of data as implementing a [Beacon v2 API](https://beacon-project.io/) can be challenging for centers that may not have allocated resources for this purpose.
