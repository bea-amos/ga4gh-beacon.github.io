The Beacon project organizes one monthly GA4GH Beacon call (which focuses on the specification), and one monthly ELIXIR Beacon call (which focuses on the implementation). In addition, we put together several working groups (or "scouts") that focus on specific aspects of Beacon. Following the "open & transparent" approach of GA4GH, the meeting minutes and outputcan be accessed either as archives or rolling documents.
