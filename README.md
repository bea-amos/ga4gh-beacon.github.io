### Website Technology

The website is built from this repository's Markdown files. After adding or editing a post in the `master` branch, the corresponding website is auto-updated using Github's actions and a mkdocs workflow.

### Managing posts

=> The easiest way to create a new post is to copy and modify an old one from the same category. <=

New web pages are created by adding Markdown pages to the [docs](./docs] directory.
